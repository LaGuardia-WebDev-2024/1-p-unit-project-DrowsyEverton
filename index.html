<br>  Jhariah is a young music artist and illustrator in his mid-20s currently known for his indie music made with his friends.
<h3> Reasons why I got into his music </h3>
<ul> 
   <li> His voice is absolutely magnificient! Such an erratic range of voice he has ( His throat must be killing himðŸ˜­)</li> 
   <li> He has a great eye for composition, theatrics and performance in music videos since he is also an animator and illustrator ( he has animated some of music videoes and made some of the album covers too!)</li>
    <li> His songs have a level of relatibily with the themes and topics he ranges between from gambling, self-isolationism, intrusive thoughts etc.</li>
    <li> His music helped me alot last year with changing my mood with all the academic pressure i felt due to many things all at once.
        </li>

<h1> Favorite Album?</h1>

<p> Why? It is one of my personal favorites for the themes expressed in the album and its songs and the cinematography and choreography was exhilirating and eyecatching!</p>
